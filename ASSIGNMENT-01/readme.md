# Fitting a simple linear regression model on housing data
## Goal
Predicting House Prices (One feature)
## Implementation
* Use SArray and SFrame functions to compute important summary statistics
* Write a function to compute the Simple Linear Regression weights using the closed form solution
* Write a function to make predictions of the output given the input feature
* Turn the regression around to predict the input/feature given the output
* Compare two different models for predicting house prices
## Algorithm
Simple Linear Regression
