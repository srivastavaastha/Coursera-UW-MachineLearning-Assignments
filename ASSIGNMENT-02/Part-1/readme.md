# Exploring different multiple regression models for house price prediction
## Goal
Predicting House Prices (Multiple Variables)
## Implementation
* Use SFrames to do some feature engineering
* Use built-in Turi Create (or otherwise) functions to compute the regression weights (coefficients)
* Given the regression weights, predictors and outcome write a function to compute the Residual Sum of Squares
* Look at coefficients and interpret their meanings
* Evaluate multiple models via RSS
## Algorithm
Multiple Linear Regression
## File Description
* .csv file is for dataset
  * kc_house_data.csv is complete dataset file
  * kc_house_train_data.csv is train data file
  * kc_house_test_data.csv is test data file
* .ipynb file is solution of the assignment
