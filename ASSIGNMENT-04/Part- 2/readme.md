# Understanding ridge regression (Part-2)
## Goal
Implementing ridge regression via gradient descent
## Implementation
* Convert an SFrame into a Numpy array 
* Write a Numpy function to compute the derivative of the regression weights with respect to a single feature
* Write gradient descent function to compute the regression weights given an initial weight vector, step size, tolerance, and L2 penalty
## Algorithm
Ridge Regression
## File Description
* .csv file is for dataset
* .ipynb file is solution of the assignment
