# Understanding ridge regression (Part-2)
## Goal
Implementing ridge regression via gradient descent
## Implementation
* Convert an SFrame into a Numpy array (if applicable)
* Write a Numpy function to compute the derivative of the regression weights with respect to a single feature
* Write gradient descent function to compute the regression weights given an initial weight vector, step size, tolerance, and L2 penalty
* We will continue to use the House data from previous assignments. (In the next programming assignment for this module, you will implement your own ridge regression learning algorithm using gradient descent.)
## Algorithm
Ridge Regression
## File Description
* .csv file is for dataset
* .ipynb file is solution of the assignment
