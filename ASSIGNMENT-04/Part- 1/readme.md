# Observing effects of L2 penalty in polynomial regression
## Goal
Understanding ridge regression
## Implementation
* Use a pre-built implementation of regression to run polynomial regression
* Use matplotlib to visualize polynomial regressions
* Use a pre-built implementation of regression to run polynomial regression, this time with L2 penalty
* Use matplotlib to visualize polynomial regressions under L2 regularization
* Choose best L2 penalty using cross-validation.
* Assess the final fit using test data.
## Algorithm
Ridge Regression
## File Description
* .csv file is for dataset
* .ipynb file is solution of the assignment
