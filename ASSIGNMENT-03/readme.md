# Fitting a polynomial regression model on housing data
## Goal
Compare different regression model
## Implementation
* Write a function to take an an array and a degree and return an data frame where each column is the array to a polynomial value up to the total degree.
* Use a plotting tool (e.g. matplotlib) to visualize polynomial regressions
* Use a plotting tool (e.g. matplotlib) to visualize the same polynomial degree on different subsets of the data
* Use a validation set to select a polynomial degree
* Assess the final fit using test data
## Algorithm
Polynomial Regression
## File Description
* .csv file is for dataset
  * kc_house_data.csv is complete dataset file
  * kc_house_train_data.csv is train data file
  * kc_house_test_data.csv is test data file
  * kc_house_valid_data.csv is validation data
  * 4 different data set files 
* .ipynb file is solution of the assignment
